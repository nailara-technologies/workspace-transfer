=head1 NAME

qwen-execution-test.pl - Test qwen model autonomous execution

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    perl qwen-execution-test.pl
    perl qwen-execution-test.pl --record
    perl qwen-execution-test.pl --versions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script helps test whether the qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m model
executes workspace commands (workspace-resume, workspace-init, etc.)
without asking for user permission.

The model's safety training causes it to seek confirmation before
executing commands, even when the system prompt has explicit
pre-authorization. This script helps track iterations of the
solution.

=head1 USAGE

1. Update qwen's system prompt with latest version
2. Run: perl qwen-execution-test.pl
3. Follow test procedure
4. Record results: perl qwen-execution-test.pl --record

=head1 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Model behavior after "workspace-resume":
- Fetches README.resume.asc (or v3.2 variant)
- Calls get_file_contents immediately (no asking)
- Outputs ONLY: "..RESUMING.."
- Stops (no commentary)

Zero confirmations required.
