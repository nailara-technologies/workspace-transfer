# Current Work Plan - Session Continuation
**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: PLANNING (not yet executed)

## Objective: Accelerate Bootstrap for Future Sessions

### Problem Statement
- Each new session requires orientation time
- Context restoration is manual
- Bootstrap documentation scattered
- No instant-start capability

### Solution: Instant Boot Documentation

Create self-contained bootstrap files that enable:
1. **Zero-time orientation** - Know project state instantly
2. **One-command restoration** - Single script to be ready
3. **Sequential checkpoint safety** - Work plan committed before execution
4. **Faster iterations** - Each session starts smarter

## Planned Actions (NOT YET EXECUTED)

### Step 1: Repository Cleanup
```bash
cd /home/claude/workspace-transfer

# Review current structure
ls -la

# Identify files to:
- Keep (essential)
- Archive (historical)
- Remove (redundant)
- Update (outdated)
```

### Step 2: Create Instant Boot Files

**File 1: `INSTANT_BOOT.md`**
- Current project state (1 paragraph)
- What works right now
- How to test it (1 command)
- Next development priorities
- Common commands reference

**File 2: `bootstrap.pl`**
- One-script workspace validation
- Check all dependencies
- Run quick tests
- Report status (✓ or ✗)
- Suggest next actions

**File 3: `QUICK_STATUS.md`**
- Ultra-compact state snapshot
- Last commit summary
- Active branches
- Pending work items
- 30-second read maximum

### Step 3: Update README.md
- Add "Quick Start for New Sessions" section
- Include bootstrap command
- Link to instant boot docs
- Keep it brief and actionable

### Step 4: Commit & Verify
```bash
./commit_checkpoint.pl "Add instant boot documentation"
git log --oneline -3
```

## Rationale

### Why Commit Plan First?
If we hit chat context limit during execution:
- Next session reads THIS file
- Knows exactly what was planned
- Can continue from last checkpoint
- No lost work or confusion

### Why Instant Boot?
- Reduces session startup from minutes to seconds
- New Claude session can orient instantly
- User can jump straight to productive work
- System gets smarter over time

### Why Repository Cleanup?
- Remove cruft that slows orientation
- Clear signal vs noise
- Easier to find what matters
- Professional organization

## Success Criteria

After this work:
1. ✓ New session reads INSTANT_BOOT.md (30 sec orientation)
2. ✓ Run `./bootstrap.pl` (validates everything works)
3. ✓ Check QUICK_STATUS.md (know what to work on)
4. ✓ Start coding immediately (no setup time)

## File Organization

```
workspace-transfer/
├── INSTANT_BOOT.md          ← START HERE (new sessions)
├── QUICK_STATUS.md          ← 30-second state snapshot
├── bootstrap.pl             ← One command validation
├── commit_checkpoint.pl     ← Already exists
├── README.md                ← Updated with quick start
├── core/                    ← Clean, essential files
├── implementations/         ← Working demos
└── documentation/           ← Detailed specs
```

## Next Steps After This Plan

1. Execute Step 1 (cleanup)
2. Commit checkpoint: "Completed repository cleanup"
3. Execute Step 2 (instant boot files)
4. Commit checkpoint: "Added instant boot documentation"
5. Execute Step 3 (README update)
6. Commit checkpoint: "Updated README with quick start"
7. Verify everything works
8. Final commit: "Instant boot system operational"

## Safety Net

This file itself is the safety net:
- Committed before execution begins
- Contains complete plan
- Enables continuation if interrupted
- Documents reasoning for future reference

**STATUS**: Plan complete, awaiting execution approval
**NEXT ACTION**: Begin Step 1 (Repository Cleanup)
