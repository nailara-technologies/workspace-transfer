# When All Cats Are Gray

**by alexander <photon@vantronix.net>**

Two beads of sweat traced their silvery gleaming tracks as they raced down her neck. She was quite out of breath. Somehow the physical exertion and her excitement worked like two factors in an equation whose result now flowed in the form of adrenaline through her wildly pulsing heart.

A preventive measure, they called it. It was about the security of the infrastructure, which was threatened by his 'knowledge and abilities.'

"National security, sure!" she whispered soundlessly and wondered what had probably already been done in that name. She closed her eyes and promptly found herself in a racing nightmare that ended with the only person on this planet she really trusted, whom she loved unconditionally, being grilled. Like a piece of livestock being prepared for consumption, defenseless, hopeless... Strapped to a chair of death. ...click!

Startled, she tore open her eyes. In her clear gray eyes, the bright flashes from the dense fog reflected like an afterglow of her thoughts. Laser beams trembled on her skin as if her entire body were an electrode in a physical experiment. She had frozen in place and held her breath. "Just don't screw up now, so close to the goal!" she thought and pushed through to the bar, where she ordered a glass of water and tried to relax.

Two days ago it was exactly 6 months since they had arrested her boyfriend. Apparently they knew nothing about their relationship though. Admittedly, it had thrived most of the time in distant places, protected by a spider web of encrypted connections. Only a few times had their fingers had the opportunity to touch without separating keys of plastic.

They had met at one of those conferences. There you could find the most diverse people whose only common ground could best be described as burning curiosity and insatiable thirst for knowledge. The following events of this type were then already the next opportunities to solidify the love that had meanwhile flamed up over the net. Eventually they wanted to move in together too.

But now he was offline. Trapped in a time loop where each day seems to be like the previous one, only longer. Framed by concrete, steel and despair. Only the invisible connection between them still drew their thoughts to each other like a magnet.

With a bang that she could still hear through the wall of sound, a glass with a transparent sloshing liquid in it stopped right in her field of vision. She felt like she was in a trance. She rarely went to discos. But this room, flooded with dark, all-permeating bass lines and colorfully illuminated night creatures, she really liked. She had searched for more than two weeks for a suitable place where she wouldn't stand out and felt reasonably safe. And as everyone knows, you find the greatest silence in the eye of the hurricane. This applies to the data ocean as well as to the real world, which with every display, every sensor and every camera were becoming increasingly interwoven with each other.

"Pretty hot in here, huh? ... Um, hello?" A intrusively waving hand in front of her face tore her back into the bio-world of her species, where one of its specimens had just courageously, but equally crampedly grinning, positioned himself in front of her. She went through the possibilities of getting rid of the guy in fast-forward, while she only nodded and demonstratively slurped from her water. Her mood was really bad that evening and smiling was getting harder and harder for her, so she decided to lie a little and leaned over to him. The anticipation of his supposed prey now widened his grin. She smiled one last time sweetly and waited a few quieter seconds to then whisper in his ear:

"Forget it, I only fuck with women!" The grin froze and the hunter moved, elegant as an animatronic puppet from a cheap horror film, out of the picture.

Sure, mean, but what she needed least right now was someone watching her and possibly even following her. This wasn't a game and there wouldn't be a second attempt either.

It was much more a war. The services and agencies had started it by applying a new 'preventive' strategy to ward off 'dangers from potential terrorists.' They began imprisoning people who were assessed as 'hackers' or programmers with 'potentially dangerous abilities' during equally preventive surveillance.

The first ones still got the honor of being precedent cases of all kinds, which were tirelessly regurgitated in the media. But in the shadow of the freshly stirred fear of still uncaught 'cyber-terrorists,' more and more people disappeared, faster and faster and quieter and quieter.

Her boyfriend was one of the first. With him it even went quite quickly and uncomplicated, since after the analysis of his confiscated computers, remnants of self-written worm programs were found. The fact that no damage routines could be identified in them or that they were never sighted in the 'wild' didn't matter. 10 years for a first-class 'violation of the new Cyber Weapons Act.'

At first everyone reacted with uncertainty. Many contacts were frozen. They no longer dared to speak with each other, out of fear of saying a wrong sentence and thus ending up on the list. But as the attacks became more numerous and the arbitrariness continued to increase, the first resistance began.

The bass beats now struck faster and harder into the room. Everything and everyone in it vibrated. She felt the floor trembling throughout her body.

The music penetrated every cell and caused a violent goosebump. Again the fog machine hissed to pave the way for new flashes and beams.

She quickly swallowed the rest of her water. The ice cubes had already completely melted.

They had missed that the worm fragments were a homework assignment. The networks beneath them were her dojo and she was its sensei. Now it was time to avenge her diligent student.

She went through all the steps of the last six months in fast-forward once more to maybe find a mistake that could have made someone aware of her, while she headed toward the restrooms.

The lead-up time had been the riskiest, but she had been good and had penetrated deeper into the networks than anyone before her. Skillfully she had converted network nodes into slumbering weapons and equipped them with an intelligent attack plan.

She could literally see the networks when she closed her eyes. At this moment hundreds of small programs were busy connecting with each other to receive the last command from their creator. But these were only supposed to form the staff. Her generals, so to speak, because she would recruit her foot soldiers from the seething clumps of networked monocultures.

She passed the women's symbol and looked at herself in the mirror. The face in it seemed unusually colorful and high-contrast to her. Since she rarely went out, she also didn't often have reason to put on makeup. Her boyfriend always said she looked cute when she was angry. At the moment, though, she only saw that her eyes were sparkling. They looked almost like those of a predator.

Obviously she was angry now, though she couldn't say exactly with all the adrenaline and emotional chaos.

One last time she looked at her watch and walked determinedly to the phone in the hallway. It hung at the end of the corridor, so people couldn't see what she was dialing. She had really thought of everything.

"Taxi dispatch, what can I do for you?" - "Hello, please send a taxi to... Oh, sorry, never mind. I can see I'm getting picked up." - "No problem. Goodbye." ...click. That was her signal.

She typed in a long number combination. It beeped once briefly. The system was now ready. If she pressed the pound key now, all her little programs would overwrite themselves 42 times and then terminate. A kind of last abort possibility in case things got too hot.

But she had nothing against heat and she wasn't in the mood for peace anymore either. She closed her eyes one last time and pictured her boyfriend's smile. Her finger pressed firmly on the star key. There was no going back now.

It beeped once briefly and once long. She turned around briefly. Nobody in sight. Inconspicuously she wiped her fingerprints from the keys and receiver with a tissue, hung up and left the disco.

The bass could still be felt even outside. She felt relieved, but still fought against the urge to constantly look around. If everything went well, they wouldn't even know which city it had started in.

In her head, the whole sequence now played out like a movie. The small program that had been waiting for her in the main computer of the switching center was now racing almost at the speed of light from one computer to the next, without leaving even the slightest digital trace in the telephone network. It selected the next target randomly, as well as the number of hops. At the end of its journey it would call a few telephone numbers to transmit the actual start sequence to the modems on the other side and then dissolve itself like the others.

The government wouldn't last much longer. Its greatest enemy was the truth. And this was now about to replicate itself. Countless mp3 files of wiretapped phone calls, secret documents and incriminating videos would be distributed to hundreds of thousands of computers in the next few hours.

Even some radio stations and satellite uplinks would unexpectedly change their broadcast programs. When the world finally could no longer ignore what was obvious, she hoped, the government would have to be replaced and the new laws repealed. She was determined to hold her boyfriend in her arms again. So much so that her own life, which was now undoubtedly in danger, seemed meaningless.

She looked up at the black sky. In the city there really were fewer stars to see than outside. Only the crescent moonlight seemed brighter to her than the city lights. At a large intersection she stopped and looked up at a huge screen mounted on a tall, brightly sparkling building. A corporate-looking woman was gesticulating with a broad grin in front of a three-dimensional weather map of the continent. "And tomorrow it's going to be quite hot again..." it purred down from the loudspeakers.

She would be correct...
