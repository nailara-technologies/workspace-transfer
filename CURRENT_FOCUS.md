### 4. Archive System with Commit Hooks üì¶
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: Not started

**Objective**: BASE32 encoded .tar.xz archives with automatic Git integration

**Key Requirements**:
- Compress workspace state to BASE32-named archives
- Git commit hooks for automatic archiving
- Archive verification with BMW checksums
- Restore capability from archives
- Archive index with searchable metadata

**Deliverables**:
- `core/p7-archive.pl` - Archive creation utility
- Git hooks in `.git/hooks/`
- Archive restore script
- Documentation in `documentation/ARCHIVE_SYSTEM.md`

---

## üîß Workspace Command System
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: In Development

**Objective**: Implement command directives for AI models to bootstrap and resume work

**Command Patterns**:

### workspace-init
Bootstrap fresh model into workspace-transfer repository
- Reads README.asc for essential 5-step bootstrap
- Confirms security awareness (PUBLIC repo)
- Reports "SYSTEM READY." when complete
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented in SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md

### workspace-resume (PLANNED)
Resume previous work session with context restoration
- Implies: workspace-init first (bootstrap before resume)
- Fetches: models/{workspace}/SYSTEM/status.md for current state
- Fetches: models/{workspace}/sessions/latest.md or CURRENT_FOCUS.md
- Loads: Active task, blockers, next steps
- Reports: "RESUMING: [task description]" then waits for user
- **Status**: üîÑ To be implemented

### workspace-improve (PLANNED)
Load workspace framework for maintenance/optimization
- Implies: workspace-init first
- Focus: Repository structure, documentation, workflows
- Does NOT resume main tasks (infrastructure-only mode)
- Loads: WORKSPACE_STANDARD.md, workflow patterns, best practices
- Reports: "WORKSPACE MODE: Ready for infrastructure improvements"
- **Status**: üîÑ To be implemented

### workspace-edit (PLANNED)
Load workspace for direct file/documentation editing
- Implies: workspace-init first
- Focus: Documentation updates, structure fixes, template edits
- Does NOT resume development tasks (edit-only mode)
- Loads: Repository structure, documentation standards
- Reports: "EDIT MODE: Ready for workspace updates"
- **Status**: üîÑ To be implemented

**Implementation Location**: SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md
**Reference**: See template for workspace-init pattern (tested and working)

**Next Steps**:
1. Design workspace-resume state restoration logic
2. Define status.md format for resumable state
3. Create resume protocol in SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md
4. Test with local models (qwen, etc.)
5. Implement workspace-improve and workspace-edit commands

- [ ] Cross-protocol compatibility (other networks)

---

## üöÄ Quick Start Recommendations

### For Filesystem Work:
```bash
# Install FUSE development libraries
sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev

# Install Perl FUSE module
cpan Fuse

# Create initial filesystem skeleton
mkdir -p core/filesystem
cd core/filesystem
```

### For Network Protocol:
```bash
# Review existing network code
cat protocol7-work/p7-protocol-desc.md

# Check available network utilities
ls -la core/

# Plan node discovery mechanism
```

### For Learning System:
```bash
# Install database dependencies
cpan DBD::SQLite

# Review pattern tracking requirements
cat documentation/ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md
```

## üé® Creative Direction

**Philosophy**: Each system should embody Protocol-7 principles:
- **Self-organizing**: Minimal central coordination
- **Harmonic**: Natural resonance in operation
- **Resumable**: All operations can be interrupted and continued
- **Verifiable**: Cryptographic integrity throughout
- **Beautiful**: Code that reveals underlying patterns

**Style Guidelines**:
- Perl scripts with clean error handling
- Modular design (one function, one purpose)
- Comprehensive documentation inline
- Test-driven development where possible
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages

---

## üìä Progress Tracking

Update this section as work progresses:

### Completed This Session
- [ ] (Nothing yet - clean slate!)

### Blockers
- None identified

### Questions for User
- Which priority should we start with?
- Any specific constraints or requirements?
- Preferred architecture patterns?

---

## üîÑ Update Protocol

When starting work on a priority:
1. Move item to "Completed This Session"
2. Create work branch if needed
3. Update progress regularly
4. Commit checkpoints using `commit_checkpoint.pl`
5. Archive when complete

---

**Next Action**: Choose a priority and begin implementation! üöÄ
