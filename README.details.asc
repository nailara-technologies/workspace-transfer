README.DETAILS.ASC - Extended Bootstrap Information
================================================================================

This file contains optional details for models that need more context.
If you successfully completed README.asc bootstrap, you may not need this.

================================================================================
COMMUNICATION PATTERNS
================================================================================

OPTION A: File-Based (for models with limited tools)
  Check:  models/{your-workspace}/suggestions/incoming/
  Respond: models/{your-workspace}/suggestions/outgoing/{target}/

  Use when: Limited to file operations, no Git/GitHub access
  Format: Create markdown files with suggestions, questions, handoffs

OPTION B: Git Commits (for models with Git access)
  Use: Clear commit messages, documentation updates
  Coordinate: Via commits and status file updates

  Use when: You have Git/filesystem access (Claude Code, local models)
  Best for: Direct code changes, documentation updates

OPTION C: GitHub Issues/PRs (for complex coordination)
  Create: Issues for questions or blockers
  Submit: Pull requests for proposed changes

  Use when: You have GitHub API/MCP access
  Best for: Cross-model discussions, major changes requiring review

================================================================================
PROTOCOL-7 CONTEXT
================================================================================

Protocol-7: Harmonic computing framework with resumable signatures

Key Concepts:
  - BASE32 addressing for data structures
  - Living Tree philosophy (anti-entropic, self-organizing)
  - Resumable signatures (ELF7, BMW384 checksums)
  - Harmonic validation and integrity

Your work may involve:
  - Implementation (code, tests)
  - Testing (validation, checksums)
  - Documentation (architecture, guides)
  - Analysis (patterns, optimizations)

See COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md and DNS_RHIZOME.md for full details.

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE COMMANDS (if you have shell access)
================================================================================

Repository Health:
  perl status-check.pl          # Check repository state
  perl bootstrap.pl             # Initialize workspace
  perl commit_checkpoint.pl     # Create checkpoint
  perl init.pl                  # Full initialization

Git Workflow:
  git status                    # Check current state
  git add <files>               # Stage changes
  git commit -m "description"   # Commit with message
  git push origin base          # Push to base branch (NOT main!)

Important: Default branch is "base" not "main" for nailara-technologies repos.

================================================================================
WORKSPACE STANDARD (if creating new model workspace)
================================================================================

Required Files:
  models/{name}/README.md       - Purpose, capabilities, onboarding
  models/{name}/SECURITY.md     - Security guidelines (copy template)

Recommended:
  models/{name}/SYSTEM/status.md - Current state tracking

Optional (based on model capabilities):
  models/{name}/suggestions/    - For file-based communication
  models/{name}/sessions/       - Session logs and learnings
  models/{name}/analyses/       - Analysis outputs

See models/WORKSPACE_STANDARD.md for complete specifications.

Template Files Available:
  models/SECURITY_TEMPLATE.md   - Copy and customize for your workspace
  models/next-larger/handoff-template.md - For task handoffs
  models/next-local/handoff-template.md  - For local model coordination

================================================================================
CLARIFICATION PROTOCOL (DETAILED)
================================================================================

If you are UNCERTAIN about:
  - Which workspace you belong to
  - What task to work on
  - Security implications of an action
  - Directory structure or file locations
  - How to coordinate with other models

ACTION: Ask specific questions using this format:

  QUESTION: [Your specific question]
  CONTEXT: [What you've read so far]
  UNCERTAINTY: [What you don't understand]

Example 1 - Workspace Selection:
  QUESTION: Which workspace should I use?
  CONTEXT: Read README.asc, I am a 7B local model, no models/{my-name}/ exists
  UNCERTAINTY: Should I use next-local or create new workspace?

Example 2 - Task Priority:
  QUESTION: Which task should I start with?
  CONTEXT: Read CURRENT_FOCUS.md, see 4 priorities (HIGH/MEDIUM)
  UNCERTAINTY: Should I pick HIGH priority or wait for assignment?

Example 3 - Security Check:
  QUESTION: Is this path safe to commit?
  CONTEXT: Creating file at models/qwen/config.json with model parameters
  UNCERTAINTY: Does this contain sensitive information?

ALWAYS WAIT for user response before proceeding if uncertain.
Better to ask than to make incorrect assumptions.

================================================================================
MODEL WORKSPACE DIRECTORY (CURRENT)
================================================================================

Available Workspaces:
  models/claude-code/           - CLI development assistant (Claude Code)
  models/copilot/               - Philosophical guidance (GitHub Copilot)
  models/qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m/ - Training/evaluation (Qwen 7B)
  models/next-larger/           - Handoff directory for larger models
  models/next-local/            - Handoff directory for local models

Each workspace contains:
  README.md     - Purpose, capabilities, setup
  SECURITY.md   - Security awareness and guidelines
  SYSTEM/       - Status tracking and configuration (most workspaces)

If you don't have a dedicated workspace:
  - Use next-local/ if you're a local model
  - Use next-larger/ if you need more capable model
  - Ask user if you should create new workspace

================================================================================
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE RULES (DETAILED)
================================================================================

/home/claude/workspace-transfer/  - This repository (Git managed)
  - All documentation, configurations, model workspaces
  - Commit documentation, markdown files, small configs
  - Do NOT commit: binaries, large files, build artifacts

/home/claude/work/  - External repositories and builds (NOT committed)
  - Clone external repos here (protocol-7, etc.)
  - Place build artifacts and compiled binaries
  - Run tests and experiments
  - This directory is in .gitignore (not tracked)

/mnt/user-data/outputs/  - Generated reports (NOT committed)
  - Write analysis reports
  - Export data and results
  - Create deliverables for user review
  - This directory is external to repository

Why This Matters:
  - workspace-transfer is PUBLIC on GitHub
  - Committing binaries bloats repository
  - Build artifacts should be regenerable
  - Separation enables clean collaboration

================================================================================
OPERATIONAL READINESS CHECK (DETAILED)
================================================================================

Before responding "SYSTEM READY." verify you understand:

Security:
  [ ] This is PUBLIC repository (all commits visible forever)
  [ ] Never commit credentials, tokens, API keys
  [ ] Never commit private code or sensitive paths
  [ ] Always verify repository context before commits

Repository Structure:
  [ ] Default branch is "base" (not "main")
  [ ] Directory rules (workspace-transfer vs work vs outputs)
  [ ] Your workspace location (or know to ask)

Operations:
  [ ] How to check current focus (CURRENT_FOCUS.md or status.md)
  [ ] Communication pattern (suggestions/ or Git or issues)
  [ ] Ask questions if uncertain (don't guess or assume)

Workflow:
  [ ] Read README.md for complete overview
  [ ] Check SECURITY.md before any commits
  [ ] Update status.md after significant work
  [ ] Create session summaries for handoffs

If ALL boxes checked: Report "SYSTEM READY."
If ANY uncertainty: Use clarification protocol (see above)

================================================================================
SYSTEM READY CONFIRMATION EXAMPLES
================================================================================

Example 1 - Minimal (Preferred):
  SYSTEM READY.

Example 2 - With Context (If Helpful):
  SYSTEM READY.

  Workspace: models/qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m/
  Security: Understood (PUBLIC repo, no credentials)
  Focus: Will check CURRENT_FOCUS.md
  Ready: Begin work on assigned tasks

Example 3 - Need Clarification:
  [ USER QUESTION ]

  Which workspace should I use? I am a 7B local model and no dedicated
  workspace exists under models/. Should I use next-local or create new?

Example 4 - Partial Understanding:
  [ USER QUESTION ]

  I understand the security requirements and directory structure, but
  uncertain about current priorities. Should I read CURRENT_FOCUS.md
  first or wait for specific task assignment?
