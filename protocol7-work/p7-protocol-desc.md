# Protocol-7: A Peer-to-Peer Resource Exchange Protocol

## Overview

Protocol-7 is a peer-to-peer communication protocol designed for resource sharing and distributed computing. At its core, it enables network participants (called "zenki") to exchange messages and share computational resources in a secure and efficient manner.

## Key Concepts

### Zenki
The fundamental agents in Protocol-7 are called "zenki" - autonomous network participants that can:
- Process and route messages between other zenki
- Provide and consume computational resources
- Start and manage other zenki
- Self-organize into efficient network topologies

### Core Components

#### The Cube
At the heart of Protocol-7 lies the 'cube' zenka, which:
- Routes messages between other zenki
- Manages authentication and session handling
- Maintains network topology
- Handles zenka lifecycle management

#### Authentication Methods
The protocol supports multiple authentication methods:
- Unix domain socket-based authentication
- Password-based authentication
- Zenka-specific authentication using session keys
- Support for custom authentication methods

#### Command Structure
Commands follow a consistent format:
```
(command_id) target.command [args]
```
Where:
- command_id: Optional numeric identifier for tracking responses
- target: Destination zenka or session ID
- command: The actual command to execute
- args: Optional command arguments

#### Message Types
The protocol supports several message types:
- TRUE/FALSE: Simple boolean responses
- WAIT: Asynchronous operation acknowledgment
- SIZE: Binary data transfer indicator
- STRM: Streaming data marker

### Session Management

1. Initial Connection
   - Client connects to server
   - Server sends protocol version banner
   - Client selects authentication method
   - Authentication process completes
   - Session enters command processing state

2. Command Processing
   - Commands can be single-line or multi-line
   - Responses are routed back to originating clients
   - Support for command queueing and deferred execution

## Security Features

- Encrypted communications using C25519 keys
- Session-based authentication
- Support for virtual keys and key signatures
- Multiple authentication methods
- Unix domain socket security for local communications

## Network Architecture

The protocol is designed to support:
- Peer-to-peer message routing
- Dynamic resource allocation
- Self-organizing network topology
- Fault tolerance through redundant paths
- Scalable network growth

## Unique Features

1. Resource Pooling
   - Idle network resources can be shared efficiently
   - Dynamic workload distribution
   - Burst capacity handling

2. Self-Organization
   - Zenki can start other zenki as needed
   - Network topology adapts to demand
   - Resource discovery and allocation

3. Extensibility
   - Custom authentication methods
   - Pluggable command handlers
   - Flexible message routing

## Current Status

The protocol is under active development with:
- Core messaging functionality implemented
- Basic authentication methods working
- Resource sharing infrastructure in place
- Ongoing work on advanced features and optimization

## Future Directions

- Enhanced peer discovery mechanisms
- Improved resource allocation algorithms
- Advanced security features
- Extended network topology options
- Marketplace functionality for resource trading

## Notes for Developers

- The protocol is implemented primarily in Perl
- Source code uses a modular architecture
- Extensive error handling and logging
- Support for development and production modes
- Built-in debugging and monitoring capabilities

## Further Reading

For more detailed information:
- Examine the zenka configuration files in `configuration/zenki/`
- Review the protocol handlers in `modules/`
- Study the authentication methods implementation
- Check the command processing logic

The protocol aims to create a decentralized computational resource marketplace while maintaining security and efficiency. Its dynamic nature allows for continuous evolution and improvement based on network needs and usage patterns.
