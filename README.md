# Workspace Transfer Repository

**Purpose**: Persistent storage for Living Tree + BASE32 Harmonic Routing System

This repository serves as fast, reliable persistent storage for Claude AI sessions,
replacing slow file-based methods with git operations (2-3 second transfers).

## ðŸŒ³ Living Tree Architecture

The Living Tree is an anti-entropic intelligence infrastructure based on:
- BASE32 harmonic routing with octal frames
- Cubic space mapping for distributed memory
- Protocol-7 integration with TRUE/FALSE constants
- Self-referential encoding (system encodes itself)

```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nailara-technologies/workspace-transfer.git
cd workspace-transfer
```

### Work on Files
All files tracked with git for instant sync across sessions.

### Commit Changes
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin base
```

## ðŸ”‘ Authentication

Uses GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with HTTPS:
- Token: `contents [rw]` permissions
- User: `workspace-transfer`
- Repository: `nailara-technologies/workspace-transfer`

## âš¡ Performance

- Clone/Pull: 2-3 seconds
- Commit/Push: 2-3 seconds
- No throttling, full version control

Replaces 10+ minute file extraction with instant git operations.
