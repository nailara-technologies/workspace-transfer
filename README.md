# Workspace Transfer Repository

> **ðŸš€ NEW SESSION? Start here:** Read `INSTANT_BOOT.md` then run `./bootstrap.pl` (30 seconds total)

**Purpose**: Persistent storage for Living Tree + BASE32 Harmonic Routing System

This repository serves as fast, reliable persistent storage for Claude AI sessions,
replacing slow file-based methods with git operations (2-3 second transfers).

## ðŸŒ³ Living Tree Architecture

The Living Tree is an anti-entropic intelligence infrastructure based on:
- BASE32 harmonic routing with octal frames
- Cubic space mapping for distributed memory
- Protocol-7 integration with TRUE/FALSE constants
- Self-referential encoding (system encodes itself)

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### For New Claude Sessions (30 seconds)
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://TOKEN@github.com/nailara-technologies/workspace-transfer.git
cd workspace-transfer

# 2. Read instant boot docs
cat INSTANT_BOOT.md        # 30-second orientation

# 3. Validate everything works
./bootstrap.pl             # One-command validation

# 4. Check current status
cat QUICK_STATUS.md        # What's happening now

# 5. Start coding!
```

### For Development Work
```bash
# Make changes to files
vim core/base32_harmonic_routing.pl

# Test your changes
perl core/base32_harmonic_routing.pl

# Commit frequently (avoid context limits)
./commit_checkpoint.pl "What you changed"

# All changes auto-pushed to GitHub
```

### First Time Setup (One Time Only)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nailara-technologies/workspace-transfer.git
cd workspace-transfer
./bootstrap.pl
# âœ“ Ready in 30 seconds!
```

## ðŸ”‘ Authentication

Uses GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with HTTPS:
- Token: `contents [rw]` permissions
- User: `workspace-transfer`
- Repository: `nailara-technologies/workspace-transfer`

## âš¡ Performance

- Clone/Pull: 2-3 seconds
- Commit/Push: 2-3 seconds
- No throttling, full version control

Replaces 10+ minute file extraction with instant git operations.
