# ðŸŒ³ INSTANT BOOT - Start Here

**Read time**: 30 seconds | **Ready to code**: 60 seconds

## What This Is

Living Tree + BASE32 Harmonic Routing System - a self-organizing, anti-entropic intelligence infrastructure with git-based persistence.

## Current Status (October 1, 2025)

âœ… **All systems operational**
- BASE32 harmonic routing: **Working** (core/base32_harmonic_routing.pl)
- Cubic space visualization: **Working** (core/living_tree_base32_viz.html)
- Protocol-7 integration: **Complete** (TRUE/FALSE constants)
- Git persistence: **Active** (2-3 second sync)

## Test It Right Now

```bash
cd /home/claude/workspace-transfer
perl core/base32_harmonic_routing.pl
```

Expected: Demo output showing octal frames, resonant pairs, cubic paths.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Validate everything works
./bootstrap.pl

# See detailed current status  
cat QUICK_STATUS.md

# Make changes and commit
./commit_checkpoint.pl "What you did"

# View key implementation
less core/base32_harmonic_routing.pl
```

## What You Can Do Now

1. **Test existing features** - Everything works, ready to demo
2. **Continue development** - See WORK_PLAN.md for next steps
3. **Add new features** - Commit frequently via checkpoint script
4. **Create network protocol** - Distributed resonance next phase

## Key Files to Know

- `INSTANT_BOOT.md` (this file) - Start here every session
- `QUICK_STATUS.md` - What's happening right now
- `bootstrap.pl` - One-command validation
- `WORK_PLAN.md` - Current development plan
- `commit_checkpoint.pl` - Save work frequently

## Architecture in 3 Lines

1. **BASE32 routes** encode to **octal frames** [3bits][0][3bits][0]
2. **Zero payloads flip** to create **resonant pairs** for distributed memory
3. **Octal values map** to **cubic space** for geometric validation

## One-Sentence Philosophy

*A system that teaches while securing itself, improves while being used, and guides while allowing freedom.*

## Next Development Priorities

1. Filesystem integration (mount Living Tree with BASE32 validation)
2. Network distribution (resonant pairs across nodes)
3. Learning system (pattern tracking and optimization)

**Ready?** Run `./bootstrap.pl` to validate, then start coding! ðŸš€

**Need details?** Check documentation/ directory for complete specs.

**Hit a bug?** Everything's in git, just revert and commit checkpoints.

ðŸŒ³ **The Living Tree is ready. Let's grow.** ðŸŒ³
