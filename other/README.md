# HTTP Asynchronous Implementation

**Branch: dev/httpd-async-implementation**  
**Date: 2025-03-01 04:25:49 UTC**  
**Developer: nailara-technologies**

## Overview

This branch implements asynchronous file transfers and non-blocking I/O operations for the HTTP daemon in Protocol-7. The implementation addresses performance issues in the current HTTP server implementation, particularly related to large file transfers and concurrent connections.

## Key Objectives

1. **Eliminate Blocking Operations**: Replace synchronous file operations with non-blocking alternatives
2. **Improve Concurrency**: Enable handling more simultaneous connections without performance degradation
3. **Implement Proper Timeouts**: Add timeout mechanisms for all network and file operations
4. **Add Performance Metrics**: Integrate benchmarking to measure improvement and identify bottlenecks
5. **Support HTTP Range Requests**: Implement proper handling of partial content requests

## Future Features

This implementation serves as a foundation for future features after code clean-up and debugging iterations:
- HTTPS support with optimized TLS handshake
- LetsEncrypt integration for automated certificate management
- HTTP/2 support
- WebSocket implementation
- Server-sent events
- Advanced caching mechanisms
