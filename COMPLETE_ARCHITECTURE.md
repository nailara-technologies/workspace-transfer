# Complete Protocol-7 Architecture

## Namespace Directory Grouping
- Dynamic depth using AMOS checksums and BASE32 C25519 keys.

## Lambda Routing
- Dual keys for session-specific routing:
  - Forward target key.
  - Reversed source key.
- Only key holders can decrypt.
- Nodes validate and drop manufactured routes early.

## Symmetric Center Home Zenki Ring
- Mass consensus mechanism.
- Personal rules filtering unwanted traffic before reaching the center.

## Layered Functionality
- Via harmonic constraints providing non-exclusive clarifying cross-correlating interlocking co-existence for stable managed abundance.

## Equidistant Zenki Ring
- 5 Zenki orbiting slowly in CCW rotation.
- Forming a 5-pointed star visible from above and below (the +2 of 7).

## Differentiation between Zenki Types
- Home Zenki:
  - Managing group existence and realtime routing.
- Working 5-of-7 Zenki:
  - First sets up session and wormhole directory.
  - Middle 2-4 process sequentially or in parallel.
  - Last collects results and syncs via hyperspace with the first.

## Anonymized Search
- Using AMOS checksums with BMW384 replies valid across network time epochs in a slowly rolling window.

## Direct Routing
- From BMW plus AMOS to reach files with header/metadata separation.
- Avoiding large file redundancies through deduplication.

## Proximity-Enabled Realtime Forensic Vision
- Error-containing leading to error-free computing through transparency and vision of true state only.
