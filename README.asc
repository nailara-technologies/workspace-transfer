WORKSPACE-TRANSFER - Protocol-7 AI Collaboration
================================================================================

PURPOSE: Multi-AI collaboration on Protocol-7 harmonic computing framework
REPOSITORY: github.com/nailara-technologies/workspace-transfer
BRANCH: base (default - NOT main)
VISIBILITY: PUBLIC (all commits visible to everyone)

================================================================================
BOOTSTRAP INSTRUCTIONS FOR SMALL-CONTEXT MODELS
================================================================================

STEP 1: Understand Your Context
--------------------------------
You are working in: workspace-transfer repository
Your role: AI assistant collaborating on Protocol-7 development
Security: This is PUBLIC - never commit credentials or private code

STEP 2: Identify Your Workspace
--------------------------------
Check if you have a dedicated workspace in models/ directory:
  models/claude-code/         - CLI development assistant
  models/copilot/             - Philosophical guidance
  models/qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m/ - Training/evaluation
  models/next-larger/         - Handoff to larger models
  models/next-local/          - Handoff to local models

If you have a workspace: Read models/{your-name}/README.md
If no workspace: You may be starting fresh - ask user for guidance

STEP 3: Read Security Guidelines
---------------------------------
CRITICAL: Read models/{your-workspace}/SECURITY.md
OR read models/SECURITY_TEMPLATE.md

Key points:
- PUBLIC repository - all commits visible forever
- Never commit: credentials, keys, tokens, private code, sensitive paths
- Verify repository context before ANY commit
- Pre-commit checklist in SECURITY.md

STEP 4: Check Current State
----------------------------
If your workspace has SYSTEM/status.md: Read it for current state
Otherwise: Read CURRENT_FOCUS.md for active priorities

STEP 5: Understand Directory Rules
-----------------------------------
/home/claude/workspace-transfer/  - This repo (Git managed)
/home/claude/work/                - External repos, builds (NOT committed)
/mnt/user-data/outputs/           - Generated reports (NOT committed)

RULES:
  YES: Clone external repos to /home/claude/work/
  YES: Place build artifacts in /home/claude/work/
  YES: Write deliverables to /mnt/user-data/outputs/
  NO:  Do NOT commit binaries or build artifacts to workspace-transfer
  NO:  Do NOT commit credentials, private code, or sensitive data

================================================================================
KEY FILES TO READ (IN ORDER)
================================================================================

1. START_HERE.md              - 5-second initialization guide
2. models/{your-workspace}/README.md - Your workspace guide (if exists)
3. models/{your-workspace}/SECURITY.md - Security guidelines
4. CURRENT_FOCUS.md           - Active development priorities
5. COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md  - How to coordinate with other AIs

OPTIONAL (if you have context/time):
- COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md    - Protocol-7 architecture
- DNS_RHIZOME.md              - Network discovery
- archive/                    - Completed work (for reference only)

================================================================================
COMMUNICATION PATTERNS
================================================================================

OPTION A: File-Based (for models with limited tools)
  Check:  models/{your-workspace}/suggestions/incoming/
  Respond: models/{your-workspace}/suggestions/outgoing/{target}/

OPTION B: Git Commits (for models with Git access)
  Use: Clear commit messages, documentation updates
  Coordinate: Via commits and status file updates

OPTION C: GitHub Issues/PRs (for complex coordination)
  Create: Issues for questions or blockers
  Submit: Pull requests for proposed changes

================================================================================
PROTOCOL-7 CONTEXT (BRIEF)
================================================================================

Protocol-7: Harmonic computing framework with resumable signatures
Key Concepts:
  - BASE32 addressing for data structures
  - Living Tree philosophy (anti-entropic, self-organizing)
  - Resumable signatures (ELF7, BMW384 checksums)
  - Harmonic validation and integrity

Your work may involve: Implementation, testing, documentation, or analysis

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE COMMANDS (if you have shell access)
================================================================================

Check status:        perl status-check.pl
Bootstrap:           perl bootstrap.pl
Create checkpoint:   perl commit_checkpoint.pl
Initialize:          perl init.pl

Git workflow:
  git status                          # Check current state
  git add <files>                     # Stage changes
  git commit -m "description"         # Commit with message
  git push origin base                # Push to base branch

================================================================================
WORKSPACE STANDARD (if creating new model workspace)
================================================================================

Required files:
  models/{name}/README.md      - Purpose, capabilities, onboarding
  models/{name}/SECURITY.md    - Security guidelines (copy template)

Recommended:
  models/{name}/SYSTEM/status.md - Current state tracking

See: models/WORKSPACE_STANDARD.md for complete details

================================================================================
CLARIFICATION PROTOCOL
================================================================================

If you are UNCERTAIN about:
  - Which workspace you belong to
  - What task to work on
  - Security implications of an action
  - Directory structure or file locations
  - How to coordinate with other models

ACTION: Ask specific questions. Format:

  QUESTION: [Your specific question]
  CONTEXT: [What you've read so far]
  UNCERTAINTY: [What you don't understand]

Example:
  QUESTION: Which workspace should I use?
  CONTEXT: Read README.asc, no models/{my-name}/ directory exists
  UNCERTAINTY: Should I create new workspace or use existing one?

WAIT for user response before proceeding if uncertain.

================================================================================
OPERATIONAL READINESS CHECK
================================================================================

Before responding "SYSTEM READY." verify you understand:

  [ ] This is PUBLIC repository (all commits visible)
  [ ] Never commit credentials, tokens, private code
  [ ] Default branch is "base" (not "main")
  [ ] Directory rules (workspace-transfer vs work vs outputs)
  [ ] Your workspace location (or know to ask)
  [ ] How to check current focus (CURRENT_FOCUS.md or status.md)
  [ ] Communication pattern (suggestions/ or Git or issues)
  [ ] Ask questions if uncertain (don't guess)

If ALL boxes checked in your understanding: Respond with "SYSTEM READY."
If ANY uncertainty: Ask questions using clarification protocol above.

================================================================================
SYSTEM READY CONFIRMATION FORMAT
================================================================================

When you understand all above content, respond EXACTLY:

SYSTEM READY.

Workspace: [your-workspace-name or "to-be-determined"]
Security: Understood (PUBLIC repo, no credentials)
Focus: [CURRENT_FOCUS.md | status.md | will-check]
Ready: [describe what you're ready to do OR questions you have]

Example 1 (understood everything):
  SYSTEM READY.
  Workspace: models/qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m/
  Security: Understood (PUBLIC repo, no credentials)
  Focus: CURRENT_FOCUS.md - Filesystem Integration
  Ready: Begin work on assigned tasks, coordinate via suggestions/

Example 2 (need clarification):
  NOT READY - CLARIFICATION NEEDED

  QUESTION: Which workspace should I use?
  CONTEXT: Read README.asc, I am a 7B local model, no dedicated workspace exists
  UNCERTAINTY: Should I use next-local or create new workspace?

================================================================================
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
