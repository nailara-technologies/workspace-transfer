=head1 NAME

workspace-sign.pl - Cryptographic signing for workspace commands

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Sign a workspace file
    ./workspace-sign.pl sign workspace-resume.yaml workspace-resume.signed.yaml
    
    # Verify a signed file
    ./workspace-sign.pl verify workspace-resume.signed.yaml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool provides cryptographic signatures for workspace commands,
giving models mathematical proof of user authorization.

Instead of claiming "user has consented" in language (which models can question),
signed files provide cryptographic proof that the user authorized the command.

=head2 Why This Works

Models' safety training accepts mathematical proof more readily than verbal claims:

  Verbal: "User has ALREADY consented" → Model: "But did they really?"
  Crypto: [Valid signature] → Model: "Math proves they did."

=head2 Signature Format

Signed files contain:
  - Original payload (workspace commands)
  - Cryptographic signature
  - Timestamp and signer identity
  - Public key for verification

Models verify the signature before executing, gaining mathematical certainty
of user authorization.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Sign workspace-resume:

    ./workspace-sign.pl sign workspace-resume.yaml workspace-resume.signed.yaml

Verify signature:

    ./workspace-sign.pl verify workspace-resume.signed.yaml

Sign all workspace commands:

    for f in workspace-*.yaml; do
        ./workspace-sign.pl sign "$f" "${f%.yaml}.signed.yaml"
    done

=head1 PROTOCOL-7 ALIGNMENT

Cryptographic signatures align with Protocol-7 principles:

  - BMW checksums: Signature verifies integrity
  - Non-destructive: Original file unchanged, signature added
  - Verifiable: Math provides proof
  - Harmonic: Consent flows naturally through verification

=head1 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Production implementation would use:
  - Ed25519 signatures (Crypt::Ed25519)
  - Proper key management
  - Timestamp validation
  - Signature expiration
  - Multi-signature support
