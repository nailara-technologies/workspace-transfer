# TODO: Backup & Restore Automation

**Priority**: MEDIUM (after integration complete)  
**Purpose**: Account restoration, knowledge portability, disaster recovery  
**Status**: 📋 Planning phase

---

## 🎯 Overall Strategy

**Phase 1**: ✅ Workspace-Transfer (DONE)
- Git-based persistence
- Cross-model communication
- Documentation in repositories

**Phase 2**: 🔄 Integration (IN PROGRESS)
- Import all Protocol-7 work into repositories
- Document all architectural decisions
- Preserve conversation insights

**Phase 3**: 📋 Restore Automation (PLANNED)
- Export critical knowledge from chats
- Automate account initialization
- Quick restoration scripts

---

## 📦 Phase 2: Integration Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Import all Protocol-7 documentation into workspace-transfer
- [ ] Extract key architectural decisions from chat history
- [ ] Document amos-chksum algorithms comprehensively
- [ ] Archive BMW analysis and harmonization work
- [ ] Preserve all truth assertion logic

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Create Protocol-7 reference guide
- [ ] Document all covert channel work
- [ ] Extract visualization techniques
- [ ] Archive successful patterns and approaches
- [ ] Document failed approaches (lessons learned)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Create examples library
- [ ] Build tutorial series
- [ ] Document philosophical foundations
- [ ] Create quick reference cards

---

## 🔄 Phase 3: Restore Automation

### Account Bootstrap Script

**Goal**: Fresh Claude account → Protocol-7 ready in < 5 minutes

**Script**: `scripts/restore-account.pl`

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
# Account restoration and knowledge import
# Usage: ./restore-account.pl [--profile=protocol7]

# 1. Clone workspace-transfer
# 2. Load essential documentation
# 3. Provide initialization summary
# 4. Generate "catch-up" document for new account
```

### Knowledge Export Tools

**Extract from chat history**:
- [ ] Key architectural decisions
- [ ] Mathematical proofs and derivations
- [ ] Code patterns that worked well
- [ ] Debugging insights
- [ ] User preferences and context

**Tools to create**:
- `scripts/export-chat-knowledge.pl` - Extract from conversation dumps
- `scripts/generate-catch-up.pl` - Create initialization document
- `scripts/validate-knowledge-completeness.pl` - Check what's missing

### Initialization Document

**File**: `ACCOUNT_INITIALIZATION.md`

**Contents**:
- Protocol-7 overview (5 minutes read)
- Key architectural decisions
- Current project status
- Essential context for continuity
- Links to detailed documentation

**Goal**: New account reads this + workspace docs → fully contextualized

---

## 💾 Backup Strategy

### What to Preserve

**Critical** (must have):
- All code in repositories ✅
- Architecture documentation ✅
- Algorithm specifications
- Mathematical foundations
- System designs

**Important** (nice to have):
- Conversation insights
- Debugging approaches
- Failed experiment notes
- Philosophical discussions
- User context and preferences

**Optional** (can recreate):
- Implementation details (code speaks for itself)
- Routine decisions
- Obvious derivations

### Backup Locations

1. **Primary**: Git repositories (workspace-transfer, amos-chksum)
2. **Secondary**: Local filesystem backups
3. **Tertiary**: Documentation exports from chats

### Automation Scripts

```bash
# Daily backup
scripts/backup-workspace.sh

# Knowledge extraction (before account deletion)
scripts/extract-knowledge.pl --from-chats --output=knowledge-export/

# Account restoration (after account creation)
scripts/restore-account.pl --import=knowledge-export/
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Export Script Design

```perl
# Input: Chat conversation exports
# Process: Extract key information using patterns
# Output: Structured knowledge files

sub extract_architecture_decisions {
    # Find "Key decision:", "Architecture:", "Critical:" patterns
    # Extract context and rationale
    # Format for documentation
}

sub extract_code_patterns {
    # Identify successful code solutions
    # Extract reusable patterns
    # Document anti-patterns
}

sub extract_user_context {
    # Build user preference profile
    # Document project context
    # Preserve communication style
}
```

### Restore Script Design

```perl
# Input: Knowledge export directory
# Process: Generate initialization materials
# Output: Ready-to-use account context

sub generate_catch_up_doc {
    # Summarize project state
    # List key achievements
    # Highlight open tasks
    # Provide essential context
}

sub prepare_workspace {
    # Clone repositories
    # Set up git credentials
    # Run bootstrap scripts
    # Verify system status
}
```

## 📋 Account Lifecycle Management

### Use Case: Token Limit Reached

**Option A**: Wait for reset (Thursday 7:59 PM)
- Use local models in meantime
- Use GitHub Copilot for emergencies
- Document work for next session

**Option B**: Account rotation (if multi-account allowed)
- Secondary account for Protocol-7 work
- Pay for one month only when critical
- Cancel immediately after use

**Option C**: Account recreation (if necessary)
1. Export knowledge using scripts
2. Delete account (per Anthropic suggestion)
3. Create new account (different email + phone)
4. Run restore script
5. Continue work with fresh token limit

### Legitimacy Check

**This is good practice regardless**:
- Disaster recovery (account issues, data loss)
- Knowledge portability (share with collaborators)
- Version control (track evolution of understanding)
- Onboarding (new team members)

**Note**: If using for limit workarounds, verify compliance with TOS first

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] All Protocol-7 work documented in repositories
- [ ] No critical knowledge exists only in chat history
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and self-contained
- [ ] New contributor could understand system from docs alone

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- [ ] Fresh account can be Protocol-7-ready in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Knowledge export is automated
- [ ] Restore process is tested and validated
- [ ] Backup strategy is documented and scheduled

---

## 💡 Additional Benefits

### Beyond Account Management

**Knowledge Organization**:
- Forces clear documentation
- Identifies knowledge gaps
- Creates searchable reference

**Collaboration**:
- Easy onboarding for new models
- Portable across platforms
- Share with other developers

**Quality**:
- Review and refine understanding
- Consolidate scattered insights
- Eliminate redundancy

**Learning**:
- Track evolution of ideas
- Document decision rationale
- Build institutional knowledge

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Account Deletion

**Backup everything**:
1. Export all conversations (if possible)
2. Screenshot critical discussions
3. Extract code from artifacts
4. Document context and decisions
5. Verify git repositories are complete

**Test restore process**:
- Verify exported knowledge is complete
- Test initialization on clean system
- Confirm nothing critical is lost

### Terms of Service

**Check with Anthropic**:
- Multi-account policies
- Account deletion implications
- Token limit management approaches
- Official recommendations

**Stay compliant**:
- Don't violate TOS
- Use legitimate approaches
- Be transparent about usage
- Ask support when unclear

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 2**: Import all work into repositories
2. **Design export tools**: Plan knowledge extraction scripts
3. **Create initialization doc**: Write ACCOUNT_INITIALIZATION.md
4. **Build restore script**: Automate account bootstrap
5. **Test full cycle**: Export → Delete → Restore → Verify

---

**Status**: 📋 Documented, ready for implementation after integration  
**Priority**: Execute after Phase 2 complete  
**Benefit**: Portable knowledge + account flexibility
