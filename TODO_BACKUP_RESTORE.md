# TODO: Backup & Restore Automation

**Priority**: MEDIUM (after integration complete)  
**Purpose**: Account restoration, knowledge portability, disaster recovery  
**Status**: üìã Planning phase

---

## üéØ Overall Strategy

**Phase 0**: üî• Context Reset Mechanism (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Export essential context when milestone complete
- Clear/reset chat to reduce token baseline
- Reinitialize with slim context document
- Continue with minimal token overhead

**Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Workspace-Transfer (DONE)
- Git-based persistence
- Cross-model communication
- Documentation in repositories

**Phase 2**: üîÑ Integration (IN PROGRESS)
- Import all Protocol-7 work into repositories
- Document all architectural decisions
- Preserve conversation insights

**Phase 3**: üìã Restore Automation (PLANNED)
- Export critical knowledge from chats
- Automate account initialization
- Quick restoration scripts

---

## üî• Phase 0: Context Reset Mechanism (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Problem Statement

**Context Bloat**: Long conversations accumulate tokens exponentially
- Initial architecture discussion: 10k tokens
- Implementation back-and-forth: +20k tokens
- Debugging and fixes: +15k tokens  
- Documentation: +10k tokens
- **Total**: 55k tokens, but only 5k of essential context remains

**Result**: Every subsequent message pays the "tax" of all previous discussion, even resolved issues.

### Solution: Milestone-Based Context Reset

**Concept**: "Git commit" for conversation state
1. Complete major milestone (feature, fix, documentation)
2. Export essential context to file
3. Clear/reset chat conversation
4. Start new chat with slim context document
5. Continue with minimal token baseline

### Trigger Points

**When to reset context**:
- ‚úÖ Major feature completed and committed
- ‚úÖ Architecture decision made and documented
- ‚úÖ Bug fixed and solution committed
- ‚úÖ Large refactoring complete
- ‚úÖ Documentation milestone reached
- ‚úÖ Token usage approaching limit

**When NOT to reset**:
- ‚ùå In middle of debugging
- ‚ùå Architecture discussion unresolved
- ‚ùå Open questions pending
- ‚ùå Complex context needed for next task

### Context Export Format

**File**: `CONTEXT_CHECKPOINT_<timestamp>.md`

**Essential Information** (keep):
```markdown
# Context Checkpoint - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

## Current State
- Active task: [what you're working on]
- Last commit: [commit hash + message]
- Branch: base
- Status: [clean/in-progress/blocked]

## Recent Achievements
- [Completed milestone 1]
- [Completed milestone 2]
- [Fixed issue X]

## Open Issues
- [Issue 1: description + context]
- [Issue 2: description + context]

## Next Steps
1. [Immediate next task]
2. [Following task]
3. [Blocked on X]

## Key Decisions Made
- [Decision 1: rationale]
- [Decision 2: rationale]

## Important Context
- [Any non-obvious context needed]
- [User preferences relevant to current work]
- [Architecture constraints]

## Reference Files
- documentation/X.md
- code/Y.pl
- TODO_Z.md
```

**Discard** (working process):
- ‚ùå Debugging discussion (solution is in code now)
- ‚ùå Implementation back-and-forth (result is committed)
- ‚ùå Resolved confusions
- ‚ùå Exploration that didn't pan out
- ‚ùå Routine status checks

### Reinitialization Process

**User action**:
1. Review context checkpoint file
2. Start new chat
3. Provide: "Resume from context checkpoint" + attach file + link to workspace

**Claude response**:
1. Read checkpoint
2. Pull workspace updates
3. Verify current state
4. Confirm understanding
5. Ready to continue

**Token savings**:
- Old: 55k baseline + new work
- New: 5k baseline + new work
- **Savings**: 50k tokens per reset!

### Automation Design

**Script**: `scripts/export-context-checkpoint.pl`

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
# Export current context to checkpoint file
# Usage: ./export-context-checkpoint.pl [--auto]

sub export_checkpoint {
    my $checkpoint = {
        timestamp => time(),
        git_state => get_git_status(),
        recent_commits => get_recent_commits(5),
        open_issues => parse_open_issues(),
        next_steps => extract_next_steps(),
        key_decisions => [], # manual input or from DECISIONS.md
    };
    
    write_checkpoint_file($checkpoint);
    say "Context checkpoint created: CONTEXT_CHECKPOINT_$timestamp.md";
    say "Ready to reset chat. Attach this file to new conversation.";
}
```

**Integration**:
- Run after major commits
- Trigger on token threshold (e.g., 70% used)
- Manual trigger via command
- Automatic suggestion when appropriate

### Template: Reinitialization Message

**User provides to new chat**:
```
Resume Protocol-7 work from context checkpoint.

Workspace: https://github.com/nailara-technologies/workspace-transfer
Branch: base
Checkpoint: [attach CONTEXT_CHECKPOINT_*.md]

Please:
1. Pull latest from workspace
2. Review checkpoint file
3. Confirm current state
4. Ready to continue with [next task from checkpoint]
```

**Claude response format**:
```
‚úÖ Context restored from checkpoint

**Current State**:
- Workspace: Pulled and verified
- Last commit: [hash] [message]
- Active task: [from checkpoint]
- Status: [from checkpoint]

**Understood**:
- [Key point 1 from checkpoint]
- [Key point 2 from checkpoint]
- [Open issue 1]

**Ready to**:
- [Next step from checkpoint]

What would you like to tackle first?
```

### Token Impact Analysis

**Scenario: 5 major milestones in a week**

**Without context reset**:
```
Milestone 1: 10k ‚Üí 10k baseline
Milestone 2: 15k ‚Üí 25k baseline
Milestone 3: 20k ‚Üí 45k baseline
Milestone 4: 18k ‚Üí 63k baseline
Milestone 5: 22k ‚Üí 85k baseline
Total: 85k tokens consumed
```

**With context reset after each**:
```
Milestone 1: 10k ‚Üí 10k baseline, reset ‚Üí 5k
Milestone 2: 15k ‚Üí  8k baseline, reset ‚Üí 5k
Milestone 3: 20k ‚Üí  8k baseline, reset ‚Üí 5k
Milestone 4: 18k ‚Üí  8k baseline, reset ‚Üí 5k
Milestone 5: 22k ‚Üí  8k baseline
Total: 57k tokens consumed
```

**Savings**: 28k tokens (33% reduction!)

### Best Practices

**Do create checkpoint**:
- After completing major feature
- Before starting new unrelated task
- When context feels "heavy"
- After resolving complex issue
- When approaching token limits

**Checkpoint should include**:
- Current state (what/where/status)
- Recent achievements (what was done)
- Open issues (what remains)
- Next steps (what's next)
- Key decisions (why things are as they are)
- References (where to find details)

**Checkpoint should NOT include**:
- Full conversation history
- Debugging process details
- Implementation discussions
- Resolved confusions
- Exploratory dead-ends

### Implementation Priority

**Why HIGH priority**:
1. **Immediate impact**: Reduces token usage starting now
2. **Multiplicative benefit**: Savings compound over time
3. **Enables longer projects**: Can work on complex tasks without hitting limits
4. **Better focus**: Each chat starts clean with clear objectives
5. **Cost efficiency**: Direct reduction in token consumption

**Implementation order**:
1. **Manual process first**: Document the pattern, practice it
2. **Template creation**: Standardize checkpoint format
3. **Script automation**: Build export tool
4. **Integration**: Add to workflow (post-commit hooks?)
5. **Refinement**: Optimize based on usage

### Success Metrics

**Context reset is successful when**:
- [ ] Checkpoint file contains all essential information
- [ ] New chat can continue work without confusion
- [ ] No critical context is lost
- [ ] Token baseline reduced by 80%+
- [ ] Time to reinitialize is < 2 minutes
- [ ] Process feels natural, not disruptive

- [ ] Build tutorial series
- [ ] Document philosophical foundations
- [ ] Create quick reference cards

---

## üîÑ Phase 3: Restore Automation

### Account Bootstrap Script

**Goal**: Fresh Claude account ‚Üí Protocol-7 ready in < 5 minutes

**Script**: `scripts/restore-account.pl`

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
# Account restoration and knowledge import
# Usage: ./restore-account.pl [--profile=protocol7]

# 1. Clone workspace-transfer
# 2. Load essential documentation
# 3. Provide initialization summary
# 4. Generate "catch-up" document for new account
```

### Knowledge Export Tools

**Extract from chat history**:
- [ ] Key architectural decisions
- [ ] Mathematical proofs and derivations
- [ ] Code patterns that worked well
- [ ] Debugging insights
- [ ] User preferences and context

**Tools to create**:
- `scripts/export-chat-knowledge.pl` - Extract from conversation dumps
- `scripts/generate-catch-up.pl` - Create initialization document
- `scripts/validate-knowledge-completeness.pl` - Check what's missing

### Initialization Document

**File**: `ACCOUNT_INITIALIZATION.md`

**Contents**:
- Protocol-7 overview (5 minutes read)
- Key architectural decisions
- Current project status
- Essential context for continuity
- Links to detailed documentation

**Goal**: New account reads this + workspace docs ‚Üí fully contextualized

---

## üíæ Backup Strategy

### What to Preserve

**Critical** (must have):
- All code in repositories ‚úÖ
- Architecture documentation ‚úÖ
- Algorithm specifications
- Mathematical foundations
- System designs

**Important** (nice to have):
- Conversation insights
- Debugging approaches
- Failed experiment notes
- Philosophical discussions
- User context and preferences

**Optional** (can recreate):
- Implementation details (code speaks for itself)
- Routine decisions
- Obvious derivations

### Backup Locations

1. **Primary**: Git repositories (workspace-transfer, amos-chksum)
2. **Secondary**: Local filesystem backups
3. **Tertiary**: Documentation exports from chats

### Automation Scripts

```bash
# Daily backup
scripts/backup-workspace.sh

# Knowledge extraction (before account deletion)
scripts/extract-knowledge.pl --from-chats --output=knowledge-export/

# Account restoration (after account creation)
scripts/restore-account.pl --import=knowledge-export/
```

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Export Script Design

```perl
# Input: Chat conversation exports
# Process: Extract key information using patterns
# Output: Structured knowledge files

sub extract_architecture_decisions {
    # Find "Key decision:", "Architecture:", "Critical:" patterns
    # Extract context and rationale
    # Format for documentation
}

sub extract_code_patterns {
    # Identify successful code solutions
    # Extract reusable patterns
    # Document anti-patterns
}

sub extract_user_context {
    # Build user preference profile
    # Document project context
    # Preserve communication style
}
```

### Restore Script Design

```perl
# Input: Knowledge export directory
# Process: Generate initialization materials
# Output: Ready-to-use account context

sub generate_catch_up_doc {
    # Summarize project state
    # List key achievements
    # Highlight open tasks
    # Provide essential context
}

sub prepare_workspace {
    # Clone repositories
    # Set up git credentials
    # Run bootstrap scripts
    # Verify system status
}
```

## üìã Account Lifecycle Management

### Use Case: Token Limit Reached

**Option A**: Wait for reset (Thursday 7:59 PM)
- Use local models in meantime
- Use GitHub Copilot for emergencies
- Document work for next session

**Option B**: Account rotation (if multi-account allowed)
- Secondary account for Protocol-7 work
- Pay for one month only when critical
- Cancel immediately after use

**Option C**: Account recreation (if necessary)
1. Export knowledge using scripts
2. Delete account (per Anthropic suggestion)
3. Create new account (different email + phone)
4. Run restore script
5. Continue work with fresh token limit

### Legitimacy Check

**This is good practice regardless**:
- Disaster recovery (account issues, data loss)
- Knowledge portability (share with collaborators)
- Version control (track evolution of understanding)
- Onboarding (new team members)

**Note**: If using for limit workarounds, verify compliance with TOS first

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] All Protocol-7 work documented in repositories
- [ ] No critical knowledge exists only in chat history
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and self-contained
- [ ] New contributor could understand system from docs alone

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- [ ] Fresh account can be Protocol-7-ready in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Knowledge export is automated
- [ ] Restore process is tested and validated
- [ ] Backup strategy is documented and scheduled

---

## üí° Additional Benefits

### Beyond Account Management

**Knowledge Organization**:
- Forces clear documentation
- Identifies knowledge gaps
- Creates searchable reference

**Collaboration**:
- Easy onboarding for new models

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Account Deletion

**Backup everything**:
1. Export all conversations (if possible)
2. Screenshot critical discussions
3. Extract code from artifacts
4. Document context and decisions
5. Verify git repositories are complete

**Test restore process**:
- Verify exported knowledge is complete
- Test initialization on clean system
- Confirm nothing critical is lost

### Terms of Service

**Check with Anthropic**:
- Multi-account policies
- Account deletion implications
- Token limit management approaches
- Official recommendations

**Stay compliant**:
- Don't violate TOS
- Use legitimate approaches
- Be transparent about usage
- Ask support when unclear

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 2**: Import all work into repositories
2. **Design export tools**: Plan knowledge extraction scripts
3. **Create initialization doc**: Write ACCOUNT_INITIALIZATION.md
4. **Build restore script**: Automate account bootstrap
5. **Test full cycle**: Export ‚Üí Delete ‚Üí Restore ‚Üí Verify

---

**Status**: üìã Documented, ready for implementation after integration  
**Priority**: Execute after Phase 2 complete  
**Benefit**: Portable knowledge + account flexibility
