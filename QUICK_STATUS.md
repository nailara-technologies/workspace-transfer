# Quick Status Snapshot

**Last Updated**: October 3, 2025 (Post-Cleanup)  
**Branch**: base  
**Status**: 🟢 Clean workspace | 🎯 Ready for new development

## 30-Second Situation Report

### ✅ Completed & Archived
- BMW Resumability (Production ready - archived)
- 5/13 Truth Harmonic Analysis (Documented - archived)
- 1-Bit Covert Channel Architecture (Proven - archived)
- Instant Boot System (Operational)

### 🎯 Active Systems (Ready to Use)
✅ BASE32 encoding/decoding  
✅ Octal frame structure with flip  
✅ Resonant pair generation  
✅ Cubic space mapping  
✅ Interactive visualization  
✅ Git persistence (2-3 sec sync)  
✅ Bootstrap & initialization system

### 🔧 Pending Development (Fresh Canvas)
⏳ Filesystem integration (Living Tree mount with BASE32)  
⏳ Network distribution protocol (Resonant pairs across nodes)  
⏳ Learning system implementation (Pattern tracking)  
⏳ Archive system (BASE32 encoded .tar.xz with commit hooks)

## One-Command Quick Test
```bash
perl core/base32_harmonic_routing.pl
```

## What To Do Next
1. Check `CURRENT_FOCUS.md` for active priorities
2. Run `perl bootstrap.pl` to verify environment
3. Run `perl status-check.pl` for detailed status
4. Review `archive/INDEX.md` for completed work reference
