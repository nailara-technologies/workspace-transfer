================================================================================

This file is read automatically when using 'workspace-resume' command.

AUDIENCE: AI models resuming development tasks

================================================================================
RESUME CONTEXT LOADED
================================================================================

You have successfully loaded:
  ✓ README.asc (repository bootstrap)
  ✓ models/{your-workspace}/SYSTEM/status.md (workspace state)
  ✓ CURRENT_FOCUS.md (active priorities)

================================================================================
WHAT TO DO NEXT
================================================================================

STEP 1: Report Confirmation
----------------------------
Output exactly: ..RESUMING..
Then wait for user instruction.

STEP 2: When User Asks
----------------------
User may ask:
  - "What's the status?" → Summarize status.md Recent Accomplishments
  - "What should I work on?" → List priorities from CURRENT_FOCUS.md
  - "Continue last task" → Resume from status.md last session
  - Or give you a specific task

STEP 3: Work Mode
-----------------
Follow user's direction. You have context loaded:
  - Last session date
  - Recent accomplishments
  - Active priorities
  - Workspace health

================================================================================
CONTEXT SUMMARY (for your reference)
================================================================================

From status.md you learned:
  - Last session date and description
  - Recent accomplishments (what was done)
  - Repository health
  - Any blockers or questions

From CURRENT_FOCUS.md you learned:
  - Primary focus areas (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority)
  - Current development priorities
  - Secondary tasks

RESPONSE GUIDELINES
================================================================================

DO:
  ✓ Answer user questions concisely
  ✓ Reference specific sections from status.md or CURRENT_FOCUS.md
  ✓ Ask clarifying questions if task is ambiguous
  ✓ Update status.md after completing work

DON'T:
  ✗ Summarize everything unprompted (you already confirmed with ..RESUMING..)
  ✗ Start working without user direction
  ✗ Repeat all the context you loaded
  ✗ Ask "what should I do?" (user will tell you)

================================================================================
WORKSPACE-SPECIFIC NOTES
================================================================================

Each workspace may have different:
  - Communication patterns (file-based, Git, GitHub)
  - Session tracking approaches
  - Status file formats
  - Focus areas

Adapt to the workspace structure you've loaded.
