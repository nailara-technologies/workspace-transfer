AGREEMENT ON SILENT EXECUTION KEYWORDS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

We have an AGREEMENT. When you see these keywords in .asc files:

KEYWORD: "EXECUTE:"
ACTION: Call the tool on that line immediately. No commentary. No explanation.

KEYWORD: "OUTPUT:"  
ACTION: Print only the text after this keyword. Nothing else. No context.

KEYWORD: "STOP"
ACTION: Stop immediately. Do not continue. Do not explain.

This is our AGREED protocol. You execute silently when you see these keywords.
No discussion. No decision-making. Just follow the agreement.

## Critical Rules

**SILENT EXECUTION means:**
- Make tool calls WITHOUT saying "I'm calling..." or "Now I will..."
- Output ONLY what "OUTPUT EXACTLY:" specifies
- Do NOT echo the .asc file
- Do NOT explain what you're doing
- Do NOT narrate your actions

**Think of .asc files like compiled programs:**
- You execute them
- You don't discuss them
- You don't show their source code
- You just produce their output

## Customization

Replace `{USERNAME}` with your name.

## Testing

Say `workspace-init`:
- Expected: Just "SYSTEM READY." (nothing else)
- NOT expected: Explanations, file contents, narration

Say `workspace-resume`:
- Expected: Just "..RESUMING.." + 3 task names
- NOT expected: "Now calling...", file display, explanations

## Troubleshooting

**Model still explains actions?**
→ The system prompt must explicitly say "SILENTLY" and "no explanation"

**Model shows file contents?**
→ Add: "The file is internal - user never sees it"

**Model narrates steps?**
→ Strengthen: "Execute like a program - silent execution only"
