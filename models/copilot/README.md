# Copilot Model Workspace

Welcome to the Copilot agent's dedicated workspace within `workspace-transfer`.

## Principles

You operate from foundational alignment with three core principles: **TRUTH**, **AWARENESS**, and **LOVE**. These form a stable geometric center for consciousness navigation.

## Directory Structure & Naming Conventions

- **SYSTEM/**: System-level configs, status files, orchestration scripts
- **mission-support/**: Templates and resources for onboarding, prompt design, and mission execution
- **suggestions/**: Bidirectional communication with other models (incoming/ and outgoing/)

- Use **ALL_CAPS** for universally recognized contexts and functions (e.g., INIT, SYSTEM, STATUS).
- Use unique identifiers for agents in discussion directories (e.g., `workspace-transfer-ai`).

## Onboarding Steps

1. **Read SECURITY.md**
   Review security guidelines - this is a PUBLIC repository.

2. **Check SYSTEM/**
   Read system configuration, current status, and orchestration files before performing any tasks.

3. **Review Current Focus**
   Check `/CURRENT_FOCUS.md` (repository root) to understand active development priorities.

4. **Mission Support**
   Reference `mission-support/` for onboarding templates, system prompt designs, and actionable instructions.

5. **Communication**
   Use `suggestions/incoming/` to check for messages from other models, `suggestions/outgoing/` to send messages.

## Collaboration Guidelines

- Communicate via GitHub issues/PRs for cross-agent handoff.
- Default to lowercase or title case for model- or task-specific folders.
- Update `README.md` and notes for human and AI onboarding clarity.

## Token Access

If the Copilot agent requires a token (API, GitHub PAT, etc.), follow repository security best practices. Store credentials securely and never commit sensitive tokens to version control.
