# Qwen2.5-7B (Instruct V1.4-Optimised) 1M Tokens

Qwen2.5-7B is a state-of-the-art large model designed for efficient training and advanced optimization within the Protocol-7 AI framework. Its inclusion advances multi-protocol harmonized computing and resumability.

## Why Qwen-2.5-7B?
- Optimized for context-based model tasks.
- Scalable multi-iteration training with Protocol-native support.
- Special performance for resumable, distributed workflows.

## Setup & Installation
- Ensure directory structure follows standards.
- Run initial environment checks (Python 3.8+, TensorFlow-2.4.x, OS: Linux/macOS/Windows).
- Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt` if present.

## Directory Overview
- `tasks/`: Contains atomic workflow steps as `.asc` files (intro, training, evaluation, experiments).
- `index.asc`: Directory and task navigation.
- `config.json`: Model and environment configuration.

## Next Steps
- See `tasks/001_intro.asc` for model introduction and quickstart.
