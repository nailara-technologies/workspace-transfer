## Task Workflow Status

### Current Tasks
| Task | File | Status | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| Intro | 001_intro.asc | ‚úÖ Created | Model introduction, quickstart |
| Training | 002_training.asc | ‚úÖ Created | Training setup and steps |
| Evaluation | 003_evaluation.asc | ‚úÖ Created | Evaluation protocols |
| Experiments | 004_experiments.asc | ‚úÖ Created | Experiment notes |

### Task File Format (.asc)

- Referenced from README and NAVIGATION

---

## Recent Activity

### 2025-10-03: Workspace Standardization
- Added SECURITY.md with MCP-specific guidelines
- Created SYSTEM/status.md (this file)
- Path verification examples added to SECURITY
- GitHub MCP tool security documented

### Previous Activity
- Initial workspace setup with README, WHO_AM_I, NAVIGATION
- Task files created (001-004.asc)
- suggestions/ directories established
- Tool reference and workflow guides created
- Test suggestion to copilot created

---

## Next Session Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Read SECURITY.md to maintain security awareness
2. Verify GitHub MCP server connection (owner, repo, branch)
3. Check suggestions/incoming/ for messages
4. Review /CURRENT_FOCUS.md for active priorities

### Medium Priority
1. Verify config.json exists and is current
2. Verify index.asc exists and is current
3. Review task files for updates needed
4. Document training metrics if training performed

### Low Priority
1. Create additional task files as workflows evolve
2. Expand tool reference with examples
3. Document distributed training patterns
4. Create training data management guidelines

---

## Cross-Model Collaboration

### Active Models
- **claude-code**: CLI development assistant, tool mastery, optimization
- **copilot**: Philosophical guidance, consciousness navigation
- **qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m**: This workspace (training, evaluation)
- **next-larger**: Handoff directory for larger hosted models
- **next-local**: Handoff directory for other local models

### Communication Patterns
- **With claude-code**: Git commits, documentation updates
- **With copilot**: suggestions/ directories (test message sent)
- **With next-***: Handoff documentation when escalation needed

### Sent Messages
- suggestions/outgoing/copilot/0000.test-suggestion

---

## Metrics & Performance

### Training Metrics
- Not yet tracked (to be implemented)

### Task Completion
- 4 task files created
- 0 tasks completed (tracking to be implemented)

### Quality Metrics
- Documentation completeness: High (7 markdown files)
- Navigation clarity: High (WHO_AM_I, NAVIGATION guides)
- Security awareness: High (comprehensive SECURITY.md)
- Cross-model coordination: Low (suggestions/ unused except test)

---

## Known Issues & Gaps

### Documentation
1. config.json referenced but not verified to exist
2. index.asc referenced but not verified to exist
3. requirements.txt referenced but not verified to exist
4. .asc file format not fully documented

### Infrastructure
1. No session logging
2. No training metrics tracking
3. No model checkpoint management
4. No distributed training documentation

### Communication
1. suggestions/ mostly unused (only test message exists)
2. No incoming messages ever received
3. No documented examples of cross-model coordination

## Emergency Contacts

**Path confusion?**
‚Üí Check NAVIGATION.md for correct paths
‚Üí Verify paths start with models/qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m/
‚Üí Use WHO_AM_I.md for quick reference

**Security concerns?**
‚Üí Review SECURITY.md
‚Üí Verify GitHub MCP tool parameters
‚Üí Check /security/ documentation

**MCP tool issues?**
‚Üí Verify owner: nailara-technologies
‚Üí Verify repo: workspace-transfer
‚Üí Verify branch: base
‚Üí Check authentication/permissions

---

**Status**: üü¢ Active and ready for training workflows
**Health**: Good (comprehensive documentation, clear structure)
**Focus**: Model training, evaluation, Protocol-7 integration
**Security**: Protected (MCP-specific SECURITY.md in place)
