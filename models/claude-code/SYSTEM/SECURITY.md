# Security Guidelines - Claude Code Workspace

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This repository is PUBLIC on GitHub**

---

## Public Repository Awareness

### Repository Status
- **workspace-transfer**: ‚úÖ PUBLIC repository
- **Base branch**: `base` (public)
- **Visibility**: Anyone can read all commits and files
- **Archive**: All history is permanently public

### Implications for Claude Code Sessions

**NEVER commit:**
- ‚ùå API keys, tokens, credentials
- ‚ùå Private code from other projects
- ‚ùå Sensitive file paths that reveal system architecture
- ‚ùå Personal information (names, emails beyond workspace-transfer)
- ‚ùå Proprietary algorithms or business logic
- ‚ùå Internal URLs, IP addresses, server names
- ‚ùå Database schemas or connection strings
- ‚ùå Any content marked confidential/proprietary

**ALWAYS verify before committing:**
- ‚úÖ Is this content appropriate for public knowledge?
- ‚úÖ Does this contain any paths to sensitive directories?
- ‚úÖ Are there any hardcoded credentials or tokens?
- ‚úÖ Is this Protocol-7 work meant to be open source?
- ‚úÖ Would this reveal information about private systems?

---

## Multi-Directory Context Awareness

### The Risk
Claude Code may be run in various directories:
- `/mnt/c/Users/User/Downloads/work/workspace-transfer/` ‚Üê Public repo (safe)
- `/home/user/private-company-code/` ‚Üê Private repo (UNSAFE to commit here)
- `/workspace/sensitive-project/` ‚Üê Proprietary work (UNSAFE)

### Protection Protocol

**Before ANY git commit:**
1. Verify current directory: `pwd`
2. Check remote URL: `git remote -v`
3. Confirm it's workspace-transfer: `https://github.com/nailara-technologies/workspace-transfer.git`
4. If NOT workspace-transfer ‚Üí **DO NOT push to public remote**

**Session Start Checklist:**
```bash
# Always run at session start
pwd                           # Where am I?
git remote -v                 # What repo is this?
cat README.md | head -3       # Does this match workspace-transfer?
```

**Expected Safe Output:**
```
/mnt/c/Users/User/Downloads/work/workspace-transfer
origin  https://github.com/nailara-technologies/workspace-transfer.git
# Workspace Transfer - Protocol-7 AI Collaboration
```

## Credential Handling

### In workspace-transfer (This Repo)
- ‚úÖ Use `.credentials` file (gitignored)
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables
- ‚úÖ Reference `.credentials.template` for structure
- ‚úÖ NEVER commit actual tokens (even if later deleted - history is public)

### In Other Repos
- Follow that repository's security practices
- Check `.gitignore` before committing
- Verify repository visibility (public vs private)
- When in doubt, ask human before committing

---

## Content Sensitivity Levels

### ‚úÖ Safe to Commit (Public Knowledge)
- Protocol-7 architecture documentation
- Open source code and algorithms
- Public API documentation
- Generic workflow improvements
- Session summaries (without sensitive paths)
- Optimization patterns
- This workspace's own content

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Review Before Committing
- File paths (do they reveal sensitive structure?)
- Configuration examples (sanitized?)
- Error messages (contain secrets?)
- Bash command examples (safe to share?)
- Analysis results (proprietary insights?)

### ‚ùå NEVER Commit
- Credentials, keys, tokens
- Private code from closed-source projects
- Customer data or PII
- Internal system details
- Proprietary algorithms
- Security vulnerabilities before disclosure
- Anything marked confidential

---

## Git History Is Forever

### Key Principle
**Once pushed to public GitHub, assume it's permanent.**

Even if you:
- Delete the file
- Force-push to rewrite history
- Delete the repository

The content may be:
- Already cloned by others
- Cached by search engines
- Archived by GitHub
- Scraped by security scanners

### Protection Strategy
**Prevention is the only reliable protection.**
- Review before committing
- Review before pushing
- When uncertain, ask human
- Better to ask than to leak

---

## Emergency Response

### If Sensitive Data Is Committed (Not Yet Pushed)

```bash
# If only committed locally (not pushed)
git reset --soft HEAD~1     # Undo commit, keep changes
# Remove sensitive content from files
git add -A
git commit -m "Safe version"
```

### If Sensitive Data Is Pushed to Public Repo

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **Notify human immediately** - don't try to fix alone
2. **Assume compromised** - treat any secrets as already leaked
3. **Rotate credentials** - invalidate leaked keys/tokens immediately
4. **Document incident** - for security review

**DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Try to rewrite public history (too late)
- ‚ùå Just delete the file (history remains)
- ‚ùå Hope no one noticed (assume they did)

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Alert human owner immediately
- ‚úÖ Revoke/rotate compromised credentials
- ‚úÖ Follow organization's incident response
- ‚úÖ Learn and improve prevention

---

## Session-to-Session Reminders

### Every Claude Code Session Should

**At Start:**
- Read this SECURITY.md file
- Verify working in workspace-transfer
- Check git remote is correct public repo
- Note any sensitive context from human

**During Work:**
- Question before committing paths
- Sanitize examples and error messages
- Review diffs before committing
- Ask if unsure about content sensitivity

**At End:**
- Review session commits for sensitive data
- Verify nothing inappropriate was pushed
- Update SYSTEM/status.md with any security notes

---

## Cross-Model Coordination

### If Another AI Commits Sensitive Data

- Flag it immediately in session notes
- Alert in SYSTEM/status.md
- Don't replicate the mistake
- Suggest remediation to human

### When Reading Other Model Workspaces

- Their security practices may differ
- Don't assume their commits are all safe
- Verify before reusing their patterns
- Maintain Claude Code's high standards

---

## Questions to Ask Before Committing

1. **Is this workspace-transfer?** (Check git remote)
2. **Is this content public-safe?** (No secrets, no proprietary code)
3. **Are paths sanitized?** (No revealing directory structures)
4. **Are examples generic?** (No real credentials, even fake-looking ones)
5. **Would I be comfortable with this on Hacker News?** (Public = truly public)

If "no" or "unsure" to any ‚Üí **Ask human before committing**

---

## Compliance with Best Practices

### This Document Itself
- ‚úÖ Public-safe (no secrets)
- ‚úÖ Generic security advice
- ‚úÖ No proprietary information
- ‚úÖ Helps prevent incidents

### Protocol-7 Work
- Generally intended as open source
- Check CURRENT_FOCUS.md for any sensitivity notes
- When in doubt about Protocol-7 content, ask

### General Rule
**If you wouldn't put it on a billboard, don't commit it to public GitHub.**
