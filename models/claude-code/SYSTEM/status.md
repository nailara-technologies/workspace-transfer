# System Status - Claude Code Workspace

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03
**Session**: Onboarding optimization and workspace creation
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Active Development

---

## Current State

### Repository Health
- âœ… Onboarding flow optimized and verified
- âœ… BMW references properly archived
- âœ… Clean entry point via START_HERE.md
- âœ… All documentation consistent
- âœ… Git synchronized with remote

### Active Focus
See `/CURRENT_FOCUS.md` for priorities:
1. Filesystem Integration (HIGH)
2. Network Distribution Protocol (HIGH)
3. Learning System Implementation (MEDIUM)
4. Archive System with Commit Hooks (MEDIUM)

### Recent Accomplishments
- Created claude-code model workspace
- Streamlined onboarding documentation
- Removed completed mission references
- Verified fresh-Claude walk-through flow
- Measured 55% token efficiency improvement

## Tool Availability Matrix

| Tool | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Read | âœ… Active | Multi-file batching working well |
| Write | âœ… Active | Used for new file creation |
| Edit | âœ… Active | Exact string replacement |
| Glob | âœ… Active | Pattern-based file discovery |
| Grep | âœ… Active | Content search |
| Bash | âœ… Active | Git operations, parallel commands |
| Task | âœ… Active | Agent delegation for complex work |
| TodoWrite | âœ… Active | Task tracking and planning |

## Workflow Templates

### Repository Analysis
```
1. Read README.md for overview
2. Glob *.md for documentation structure
3. Read key files (CURRENT_FOCUS, START_HERE)
4. Grep for specific patterns if needed
5. Create analysis in analyses/
```

### Documentation Update
```
1. Identify inconsistencies
2. Create TodoWrite task list
3. Edit files with exact string replacement
4. Verify changes with fresh walk-through
5. Commit with descriptive message
```

### Session Handoff
```
1. Create session summary in sessions/
2. Update this status.md
3. Commit all changes
4. Push to remote
```

## Performance Metrics

### Token Efficiency
- Onboarding optimization: 55% reduction (2000 â†’ 900 tokens)
- Parallel tool calls: Consistent use across session
- Targeted reading: Only read what's needed

### Time Efficiency
- Onboarding walk-through: < 5 seconds (measured via simulation)
- Documentation consistency: Fixed in single session
- Git operations: Batched effectively

---

## Known Patterns

### What Works Well
- Parallel reads for exploration
- TodoWrite for multi-step tracking
- Simulation-based verification
- Incremental commits with clear messages

### Antipatterns to Avoid
- Reading entire files when targeted sections suffice
- Creating files proactively without request
- Batching dependent operations
- Skipping verification after changes

---

## Next Session Recommendations

### High Priority
- Review CURRENT_FOCUS.md for active work
- Check for uncommitted changes (git status)
- Read recent sessions/ for context
- Verify no stale references remain

### Medium Priority
- Consider adding performance tracking tools
- Explore automation opportunities
- Document emerging patterns in optimizations/

### Low Priority
- Archive old session logs if accumulating
- Optimize directory structure if needed

---

## Cross-Model Collaboration

### Active Interactions
- Copilot: Shares workspace structure patterns
- Other models: Can reference this workspace design

### Communication Channels
- Git commits for asynchronous handoffs
- Session summaries for context transfer
- Shared docs (CURRENT_FOCUS, etc.) for coordination

## Emergency Contacts

**Stale references found?**
â†’ Check archive/ for completed work
â†’ Update documentation to remove references
â†’ Commit with "Remove stale content" message

**Onboarding broken?**
â†’ Simulate fresh-Claude walk-through
â†’ Verify START_HERE â†’ status-check â†’ CURRENT_FOCUS flow
â†’ Fix inconsistencies immediately

**Git conflicts?**
â†’ Pull latest
â†’ Review changes
â†’ Merge with care for documentation
â†’ Test walk-through after merge

---

**Status**: Ready for next session ðŸš€
