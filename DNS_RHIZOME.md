# DNS Rhizome Network Discovery Documentation

## Concept Explanation
The DNS Rhizome Network leverages the Domain Name System (DNS) as a foundational technology for discovering nodes in a decentralized network. This approach mimics the structure of a rhizome, where nodes connect peer-to-peer in a non-hierarchical manner, akin to underground root networks.

## Advantages of DNS over Traditional Approaches
1. **Decentralization**: Unlike traditional centralized systems, DNS allows for a distributed method of node discovery.
2. **Scalability**: DNS can scale to accommodate a growing number of nodes without performance degradation.
3. **Reliability**: The redundancy in DNS records minimizes the risk of single points of failure.
4. **Ease of Use**: DNS is already widely understood and implemented, providing a familiar interface for developers.
5. **Interoperability**: DNS works seamlessly with existing internet protocols, facilitating integration with various services.

## TXT Record Format
The TXT record format for the DNS Rhizome may look like this:
```
v=proto7 vm=zenka loc=de cost=5.38 ram=8192 bw=32768 harmonic=384615
```
- **v**: Protocol version
- **vm**: Virtual machine identifier
- **loc**: Location (country code)
- **cost**: Cost of accessing the node
- **ram**: RAM available at the node
- **bw**: Bandwidth available
- **harmonic**: Harmonic value for node performance

## SRV Record Format
The SRV record format is structured as follows:
```
_priority_ _weight_ _port_ _target_
```
- **priority**: The priority of the target host
- **weight**: A relative weight for records with the same priority
- **port**: The port on the target host
- **target**: The canonical hostname of the machine providing the service

## DNSSEC Signature Verification
DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide a mechanism to verify the authenticity of DNS records. This ensures that the information received by nodes is legitimate, protecting against various attacks such as cache poisoning.

## 5-of-7 Consensus Algorithm Implementation with Ring Topology
The 5-of-7 consensus algorithm allows for a flexible yet robust decision-making process among nodes in a ring topology. This method requires that at least five out of seven nodes agree on a transaction, enhancing security and reliability in node interactions.
